  % APA 6th edition LaTeX template. Use this as a basis for writing documents that have to meet guidelines for the American Psychological Association. This has been optimized for "man" option, or manuscript format, which outputs a double-spaced, single column document that is designed for coursework or journal submissions. The inline comments assume you have some minimal working knowledge of LaTeX. Further, this is currently set up for managing references with biblatex and biber.

  % To be clear, this template is not endorsed by the American Psychological Association, the maintainers of the apa6 document class for LaTeX, or anyone else of great importance. For more documentation on using apa6, refer to its page at CTAN <http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/apa6>.

% The following four fields make up some of the front matter of your document. If working on an assignment for a course, I typically use "affiliation" for the class name. I have commented out abstract since minimal usage doesn't require it and leaving it blank will generate a blank page. Ignore the warning about the lack of abstract.

\maketitle

% This is where the bibliography goes. Finish the body of your paper before this point, other than the appendix. 
\printbibliography

% I have commented out the appendix section since it isn't a standard for minimal documents.
